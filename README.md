Observations and Insights
•	The effectiveness of Capomulin and Ramicane are similar, but are significantly more effective than Infubinol and Ceftamine (see box plots of final tumor volumes)

•	The heavier the mouse, the less effective the drug is (see scatter plot). This is a reliable conclusion due to strong r-value correlation (0.95) resulting from the linear regression.

•	The results of the study are very consistent, and therefore reliable. In the dataset for the top drugs there is only 1 outlier and none for Capomulin

In this study, 249 mice identified with SCC tumor growth were treated through a variety of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticals' drug of interest, Capomulin, versus the other treatment regimens. A top-level summary of the study results in the form of have been generated for the technical report of the study
